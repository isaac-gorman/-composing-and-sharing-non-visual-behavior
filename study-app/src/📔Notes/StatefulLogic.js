// Learning Objective:
// - Define what "Stateful Logic" is AKA Non-Visual Behavior

// Q: Why is it important to understand everything we can do within a component? What is everything I can do within a component?
// - Up to this point in my studies I have learned to do 3 things within components
// - - 1) Store Data within a component (Components as storage)
// - - 2) Managed Data within a component (Components as managment)
// - - 3) Used components to render() elements to the DOM (Components as mechansims to render)
// - React components do store and manage data, and render elements to the DOM but they are also capable of a 4th capability "holding Logic".
// - In the following material I will learn more about "Stateful Logic" and how React components hold and use logic within their components.
// - After this module I should began to recoginze the occuarnce of "Stateful Logic" within components.

// Q: What is "Stateful Logic"?
// - "Stateful Logic" is the logic that is built into a component.
// - Some examples of stateful logic are functions:
// - - That handle click events
// - - That set toggle state
// - - That format data before they display
// - Often time you use stateful logic to deal with "state" within a component
// - Maybe stateful logic is logic that alters state?
