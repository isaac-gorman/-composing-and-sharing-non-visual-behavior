// Learning Objective:
// - Learning to apply non-visual behavior (stateful logic) with custom hooks

// Q: Where would I have used non-visual behavior before?
// - I may have used non-visual behavior without even realizing it, for example when when managing stateful logic.
// - Q: What does effecinet have to do with non-visual behavior?
// - - Non-visual behavior can be used to not repeat code.

// Q: Define Custom Hooks, and their usage?
// - Custom hooks are slef made hooks, that re built to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throught my components.
// - If a custom hook is built correctly they can be re-used over and over again throught the application.
// - Custom hooks follow the same naming convention of hooks that I am used to with useEffect and useState ... they all start with "use".
// - Usecases for custom hook is only limited to my capabilities to reconginze repeated logic, some examples include:
// - - handling controlled inputs
// - - managing event listeners
// - - watching for key presses

// Q: What do they have to do with non-visual behavior?
// - Seems that custom hooks are mechanism to build non-visual behavior amoungst my components.
// - They are also used to not repeat logic throughout an application.
